**                   Module 12 Challenge      **
************************************************

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom,
and gives them a food hygiene rating. I've been contracted by the editors of a food
magazine, "Eat Safe, Love", to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their
journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

In Part I of this challenge, I'll create a Jupyter notebook and will import data into a 
NoSQL database (Mongo database) from the UK Food Standards Agency. I'll use PyMongo to
review, organize, and clean the data. This entails:
    1. creating a new database
    2. creating a new collection within the database
    3. assigning the collection to a variable

Other concepts that will be demonstrated in Part I:
1. adding a new document to the collection
2. updating a document in the collection
3. deleting documents from the collection
4. changing datatypes within each document

In Part 2 of this challenge, I'll undertake analysis of the data with the intent of
answering several questions. This analysis will demonstrate the following concepts:

1. basic querying, and use of the aptly named, "count_documents" method  to obtain
   the number of documents meeting a specified criteria within a collection.
2. using conditional statements to retrieve records
3. using $regex to find records
4. using compound conditional statements, e.g., "greater than X, and less than Y"
5. extracting nested data
6. sorting
7. implementing an aggregation pipeline
